**Prep**

Patient is positioned frog-leg for prep (and is returned to supine during draping). Chloroprep (2 sticks) of abdomen and lower chest up to the level of nipples (in case urgent chest tube needed). Particular attention to prepping as far as possible to the left lateral side and the right lateral side. Prep continues inferior to base of pubis. At the end of prep, bilateral groins are prepped.

**Drape**

Transverse 1000 drape is placed at the base of the pubis. On either side, the drape proceeds inferior and lateral to include both groins. Legs are returned to supine position and Velcro strap placed at thighs. Top gloves are changed.

Blue utility (paper) drape is placed transversely just above level of pubis. While the abdominal skin incisions are being closed, ICG will be injected into bilateral groins.

1000 Drapes x4 in rectangular fashion with top of field 10cm above xiphoid and bottom at base of penis. Ioban strips (4") aound the periphery of the surgical field after the trauma drape. Laparoscopic cords (CO2, light cord, camera) passed off. Suction irrigator brought off field.

### Time Out

Review:

-   Consent
-   Comorbidities, including cardiopulmonary disease
-   Anticoagulation plan. If preoperative heparin was held for epidural, plans for timing of its administration. Circulator and anesthetist set alarms.
-   Prior abdominal or thoracic operations
-   Allergies
-   Blood
    -   Surgeon’s expectation of blood loss
    -   Availability of blood (type/screen vs type/cross).
    -   Blood product administration limitations, if any
-   Introduction by name and role
-   Co-surgeons: Confirm availability prior to incision
-   Operative plan
-   Request ICU bed in STICU

*Comorbidities:*

Cardiopulmonary disease. If echo, ejection fraction and aortic valve area (if abnormal)

Beta blockage: Note whether patient on home beta blockade and if so, whether home medication was taken the morning of surgery.

Anticipated Intraop Problems:

-   Possibility of tension left pneumothorax due to carbon dioxide entry into left chest during mediastinal dissection
-   Expectation of ventilatory difficulties due to carbon dioxide entry into the right chest Gastric mobilization – Greater Curvature

## Laparoscopy

### Lesser Sac Dissection

Gastrohpeatic ligament divided. Celiac axis evaluated for resectability. Right crus dissected to ensure resectability. Dissection carried anteriorly and left crural dissection begun. Dissection posterior to esophagus.

Central node dissection begun, including common hepatic, left gastric, celiac, and proximal splenic aftery nodes. If replaced left hepatic artery present, may require preservation of left gastric artery. Left gastric artery divided with clips.

Posterior gastric dissection. Dissection is carried posterior towards most superior short gastric arteries (as these can be difficult to approach from the greater curvature side). (Penrose drain can be placed at this part of the operation)

## Distal Greater Curve

The course of the right gastroepiploic artery is identified and the lesser sac entered to the left of midline. Dissection proceeds to the patient's right. Right gastroepiploic artery carefully preserved and gatrocolic omentum incised. Dissection proceeds to right to mobilize colon off duodenum. Kocher maneuver performed and omental adhesions to gallbladder taken down.

## Posterior Stomach

Posterior dissection elevating stomach. Divide posterior gastric arteries. Dissection plane up to fundus and to short gastrics.

+---------------------+--------+-----------------+--------+

Pyloromyotomy is performed with camera in Port #2 and hook in Port #3 and Tip up in Port #4 (may need to move camera to midline)

## Pyloric Drainage - Pyloroplasty (optional)

Stay sutures of 2-0 silk are placed cephalad and caudad to pyorus. Pyloric incision is made with hook cautery. Defect is closed with 2-0 silk cut to 6" (have 2 sutures ready)

## Creation of Conduit

"Ruler" is created by making 1cm marks with black marker on Tip up. Tip up grasper placed into Port #4. Robotic stapler is introduced into Port 2. Staple line starts \~5cm from pylorus. First firing with Green (4.8mm) stapler load followed by Blue loads. Conduit is created with goal of 3-4cm. Assistant retracts fundus towards left upper quadrant. Vicryl suture is placed 2cm above the start of the staple line (approximately 7cm from pylorus).

## Preparation of Conduit

| Arm 1               | Arm 2A | Arm 3                             | Arm 4 |
|---------------------|--------|-----------------------------------|-------|
| Fenestrated Bipolar | Camera | **SutureCut Large Needle Driver** | ----- |

: Conduit is sutured to specimen with multiple sutures of 2-0 silk (cut to 6"). Arm 4 is undocked and 19 Fr Blake drain (JP2) is introduced through the port. The drain is sutured to specimen with 2-0 silk cut to 4". JP2 is brought out through the LLQ 5mm assistant port or through the port for Arm #4.

## Prep for Thoracic Phase

Once conduit has been constructed, confirm presence in room of bean bag, two pillows, and an extra OR bed for transition to lateral decubitus position. Check with Dr Salo - May just use lateral positioner and well-leg holder.

## Preparation for ICG

One vial of ICG is resuspended with 10mL of water. 5mL of the solution is brought onto the sterile field in a 5mL syringe, which is fitted with a 25Ga needle. The remainder of the ICG is given to Anesthesia for later (intravenous) use.

## Jejunostomy

| Fenestrated Bipolar | Camera (30 up) | **SutureCut Large Needle Driver** | Tip Up |

: Prior suture on jejunum is identified and grasped with suture passer at the pre-marked site. Two passes are made with the suture passer similar to transfascial sutures on a Stoppa hernia repair. 3-0 Stratafix on RB-1 is introduced with a non-cutting needle driver into Port 3. Insufflation pressure reduced to 8m Hg. Jejunum is sutured to abdominal wall starting at 10:00. Pursestring is run to 2:00 position and 16Ga needle from a 14Fr Cook Introducer kit passed through the abdominal wall into the bowel. Insufflation of air confirms proper position. J wire and 14FR dilator followed by 18Fr dilator introduced and left in place. Pursestring continues around proposed site and then proceeds caudad to provide a broader area of fixation between bowel and abdominal wall. Tract is dilated with 18Fr dilator. 14Fr MIC jejunostomy 8200-14 (trimmed to 10cm) is introduced through 18Fr sheath and positioned within the bowel. 5mL of water in a slip-tip (non-Luer) 10ml syringe (from the Cook introducer kit) are instilled into the jejunostomy balloon.

## Drains

Once jejunostomy in place, JP1 and JP2 are routed lateral to jejunostomy and brought out through Port #4 and Port #3.

## Closure

Robot is disengaged and kept sterile. Laparoscopic cords are placed in a basin on a ring stand to be reused for the thoracic portion.

Abdomen is desufflated and ports removed. Port #2 site is closed by tying 0 Vicryl suture. Port sites are closed with 4-0 Monocryl followed by Dermabond.

## ICG injection into groin.

While port sites are being closed, "loincloth" is removed and hockey stick or small T ultrasound transducer is brought onto the field. Under ultrasound guidance with sterile ultrasound jelly, ICG is injected into groin nodes.

## Thoracic Phase

## Transition to Corkscrew Position

Patient's chest is rotated to the left. Rectangular positioner supports scapula. Circular positioner on Left side supports chest. Rectangular positioner along left greater trochanter. Right arm rests on pink foam pad on Well Leg Holder.

## Transition to Lateral Position

Patient placed on bean bag. Rectangular positioner along left hip. Right arm rests on pink foam pad on Well Leg Holder.

Lower and upper body bair hugger used. Right arm is elevated for prep and lowered once drapes in place.

## Prep and drape

Chloroprep including axilla and proximal right arm. Drape axilla/upper arm with 1000 drape.

Two blue "U" drapes used, folowed by trauma drape (or Universal). Ioban strips around edges. Once Ioban in place, right arm is lowered

Laparoscopic instruments are kept sterile and may be returned to the field if pleural adhesions are encountered.

### Thoracoscopy

Gas pressure turned down to 8mmHg in preparation for the thoracic phase. A site for entry in to the left chest is selected just posterior to the tip of the scapula OR lateral to nipple. An incision is made here and a 5mm optical port with a 5mm 0 degree scope used to enter the chest. The chest is insufflated at 8mmHg of carbon dioxide, which helps to both copllapase the lung and depress the diaphragm. One 12mm port is placed just lateral to the diaphragmatic reflection. It is ciritcal to avoid injury to the diaphragm (and liver) with the inferior port placement. A mini-thoracotomy incision is placed along the mid-axillary line, frequently in the same interspace as the inferior/anterior 12mm port. The chest is entered just superior to the rib and the intercostal muscles divided with the LigaSure device to allow the ribs to separate. A narrow Deaver retractor is used to guage the space between the ribs, as the width of the retractor approximates the diameter of the 25mm stapler. A 5mm ‘U’ port is generally placed as high as possible midway between the scapular tip port and the anterior/superior 12mm port t0o the 4 right 5

## Thoracic Dissection

The 1688 "Green" scope is used to identify the course of the thoracic duct. If a disruption is found, the duct is mass ligated as low as possible with 3-0 Stratafix on RB-1 needle.

## Delivery of Conduit into chest

The conduit is delivered into the thorax. This is done using a laparoscopic grasper. Ensure staple line faces you (right side). The specimen is removed through the assistant port incision. Stomach is pulled into the chest until the **Vicryl marker suture** is seen.

Division of esophagus just above level of azygous vein. ICG can be administered intravenously to check perfusion. If there is any question about the length of the conduit, confirm the length of the conduit prior to division of the esophagus.

Penrose drain is recovered. Specimen is sent for frozen section with instructions to freeze proximal margin.

## Preparation of conduit

The gastric conduit is placed into the mediastinum by tucking it medially from the right pleura into the posterior mediastinum, in order to allow the conduit to take the most direct path from the hiatus to the proximal esophagus. Gentle superior tension is now applied to the conduit in order to eliminate redundancy.

## Circular stapled anastomosis - Orvil

OrVil The OrVil device is now used to place a EEA anvil into the distal esophagus. In general, a 25mm size is selected, unless the patient has particularly small frame, in which case a 21mm size is used. Two stay sutures of 2-0 silk on RB-1 needles are placed in the center of the esophageal staple line 3mm apart. A Harmonic scalpel is used to divide the staple line. The OrVil device is passed through the mouth and is passed through the fenestration in the staple line. The anvil portion of the OrVil is oriented so that the rounded portion is placed against the roof of the mouth. The OrVil is guided into the hypopharynx by pulling on the the tube end of the device. As the anvil approaches the hypopharynx, the jaw is pulled forward to allow passage of the anvil.

The shaft of the anvil is brought through the esophageal staple line, and the tube disconnected from the anvil by cutting the blue sutures.

The superior end of the conduit is opened along the staple line and the DST XL stapler (matching the diameter of the OrVil) introduced through the Alexis device (Port #2). The stapler shaft is placed into the open end of the gastric conduit and the conduit pulled over it (‘sock over shoe’). The stapler spike is brought out through the greater curvature. The anvil is grasped with a Maryland grasper placed through a superior 5mm port and the two components of the stapler are mated and the stapler tightened and fired. The knob of the stapler is rotated two turns counter-clockwise until a click is felt, at which time the anvil will flip. The stapler is withdrawn and the donuts examined and sent for pathologic exam.

The anastomosis is completed by firing a 60mm Gold load across the conduit cephalad to the anastomosis. The excess conduit is retrieved through the Alexis port and sent for pathologic exam as ‘additional gastric margin.’

## NG Tube

A Covidien Salem Sump 18Fr nasogastric tube is passed by the anesthetist. A laparoscopic BK ultrasound is used to monitor the passage of the NG tube through the esophagus and into the gastric conduit. The NG tube is passed to the level that all for dots are outside the nose, with the 4th dot at the nares. The NG tube is secured with an AMT bridle.

## Chest Tube

A 28Fr Blake chest tube is placed through the anterior/inferior 12mm port and is positioned into the posterior mediastinum. JP2 is placed near the gastric conduit. The right lung is re-inflated.

## Closure

The stapler access port incision is closed with 0 Vicryl to approximate the serratus muscle. The incisions are closed with 4-0 Monocryl followed by Dermabond.
