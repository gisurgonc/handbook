# Outpatient Esophagectomy {#outpt_mie}

Patient are usually seen 7-10 days after hospital discharge. By system:

## Neurologic - Pain control

Patient are typically discharged on:

- acetaminophen 1000mg qid
- gabapentin 300mg tid (liquid)
- oxycodone elixir 5mg q6 hrs prn

If patients need additional oxycodone, this is renewed 2 weeks at a time, typically to correspond to a clinic day.  Their current daily usage at the time of their first postop visit is estimated, and the first prescription plans for the same daily amount for a two week period.  If they are taking 5mg of oxycodone 5 times per day, a prescription is prepared for 5 x 14 = 70 doses. The prescription is annotated "Two week supply at 5 doses per day".  Patients are told the prescription will be renewed 2 weeks later at a reduced dose (typically one fewer dose per day). If the oxycodone bottle is lost, patients are prescribed tramadol (50mg q6 hours).  Patient are told that if they need long-term pain management, they will need the assistance of their primary care provider.

Patients are instructed that they are not "cleared" for driving as long as they are taking oxycodone

## Respiratory

Pleural effusion (typically on the right) is a risk after esophagectomy.  If the lung exam suggests a pleural effusion, a chest x-ray PA/Lateral can be obtained same-day in LCI I.

Chest incisions should be inspected for signs of wound infection and retained silk (black) suture at the chest tube site

## GI

Patients who pass their modified barium swallow are discharged on protein shakes and water by mouth. They are advanced to a Phase I diet at their first post-operative visit.

Patients who do not pass their modified barium swallow will need an outpatient MBS ordered at the first postop visit.  They will contine with either 1) meds via J tube or 2) meds with thickened water, depending upon their MBS results in the hospital.

Skin staples are removed, and the jejunostomy site inspected for infection.  Infections are treated with Augmentin for 7-10 days.  In some cases, infected cuffed jejunostomy tubes will need to be replaced in interventional radiology.  See [J tubes](31-outpt_jejunostomy.htm)

Tube feeds are typically run for 16 hours nocturnal - 5 cartons for men (75mL/hour) and 4 cartons for women (60mL/hour).


**Diarrhea** Loose stools during the day are to be expected, but diarrhea at night is problematic both for sleep and quality of life. This may require a change in formula from intact protein (Osmolite 1.5) to a peptide formula (Vital 1.5).  If patients are taking enough protein orally through protein shakes, it may be possible to decrease the rate of tube feeds.
