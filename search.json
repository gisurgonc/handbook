If patient is scheduled for central venous port Confirm that a port has not already been placed Prior history of central venous lines? Confirm location of port placement with surgeon (left vs right)\nOperation\nIf a central venous port is placed, the port is performed first. See IJ Port\nAbdominal access is obtained in one of two ways:\nInfraumbilical approach using modified Hasson technique. If the peritoneum is not easily entered, a Veress needle is used to insufflate, followed by incision of the fascia with a 15 blade, and a 5mm optical port (Applied Medical Kii Fios First Entry Z-Thread Trocar) Veress needle inserted in LEFT upper quadrant just inferior to costal margin. Abdominal entry with 5mm optical Z-Thread port. 5mm port in right upper quadrant, 5mm port in RLQ just lateral to rectus, 5mm camera port between RUQ and RLQ ports\nThe transverse colon is now elevated (using the umbilical port, if used) and the ligament of Treitz is identified. The proximal bowel is arranged in a “C” configuration to confirm the proximal and distal ends of bowel.\nA site for placement of the jejunostomy is selected on the skin, left lateral and just superior to the umbilicus. A site is selected on the bowel in the most proximal site on the jejunostomy selected which would allow for placement of the jejunostomy without tension, but at least 20cm from ligament of Treitz.\nThe proximal jejunum is sutured to the anterior abdominal wall with 2-0 silk. This is usually done with a 9″ suture which is introduced into the abdomen with a needle driver “Korean Style” or “Paraguayan Style.” Two cm distal to this suture, a diamond of sutures is placed around the proposed tube site, and one suture placed distal to avoid torsion. The final arrangement of sutures is one proximal and one distal and 4-6 sutures around the tube. All sutures were marked with hemostatic clips to facilitate replacement of the tube via fluoroscopy should the tube become dislodged.\nUsing Seldinger technique, a 14Fr Cook catheter introducer kit is placed within the jejunum, followed by a 18Fr dilator and sheath\nA MIC 14Fr jejunustomy tube (0200-14) is inserted and the balloon inflated with 5mL of sterile WATER. The ballon valve is labeled for 7-10mL of water, but this risks obstruction of the jejunum.\nThe tube is dressed with a BioPatch and a Tagederm dressing.\nThe abdomen is desufflated and the port sites closed with 4-0 Monocryl, followed by Dermabond.\nEndoscopy\nThe scope is set up:\n\nSuction and aspiration valves inserted and working\nSuction tubing attached Biopsy valve attached and not leaking\nCart set up for recording by powering on the Stryker SDC digital capture box\n\nA bite block is used and the scope lubricated.

A 30 degree scope is passed inferior to the falciform ligament into the left upper quadrant over the lateral segment of liver. The post of the scope is positioned to the left, allowing visualization of the lesser curvature of the stomach with the end of the scope near the left aspect of the falciform.\nA site for placement of the gastrostomy is selected on the skin, using a 22Ga needle as a finder. The site is marked, then infiltrated with local anesthetic and a 5mm transverse incision made.\nEndoscopy is performed and the following noted:\nLevel in cm from the incisors, of the most proximal area of Barrett’s esophagus. Level in cm from the incisors of the GE junction Appearance of the GE junction on retroflexed view. Extent of invasion of the tumor into the cardia or fundus.\nA bite block is positioned (unless the patient is edentulous). The endoscope (usually a neonatal scope) is introduced into the esophagus and the video capture started. If the tumor will not allow passage of the scope, do not force the scope.\nOnce the scope is passed into the stomach, the fundus and duodenal bulb are suctioned.\nInsufflation is then reduced to 4mm and the stomach insufflated to find the optimal location for tube placement which will minimize tension and will avoid injury to the right gastroepiploic artery. The reduced laparoscopic insufflation pressure allows endoscopic insufflation of the stomach.\nGastrostomy tube placement is done either by Pull or Seldinger technique.\nSeldinger Gastrostomy\nFour T-fasteners are then used to affix the stomach to the anterior abdominal wall. These are arranged at 8:00, 10:00, 2:00, 4:00 relative to the proposed tube site. T-fasteners are not placed inferior to the tube site to avoid injury to right gastroepiploic vessels.\nThe J wire is then passed into the stomach, followed by the dilators, up to 20Fr. A 16Fr MIC gastrostomy tube is introduced and the balloon inflated with 7mL of water.\nPull Gastrostomy\nA 20Fr PULL PEG tube kit is opened. The snare and tube are passed to the upper operator. The snare is passed through the scope and opened in anticipation of the passage of the wire.\nThe angiocath from the kit is placed into the stomach through the abdominal wall. Once the snare has grasped the angiocath, the needle is withdrawn and the split wire passed through the Angiocath into the stomach. The snare is adjusted to grasp the split wire, which is pulled out through the mouth.\nThe laparoscopic port site is considered clean. The PEG tube, once it is pulled through the mouth, is considered dirty. The right abdomen is covered with a towel to protect the laparoscopic site.\nThe recording is now stopped. The split wire is joined to the PEG tube, which is pulled into place by the abdominal operator. The tapered portion of the tube will be the first source of resistance, which may require firm traction. The split wire (and PEG tube) is dropped of the table to the patient’s left.\nOnce the tapered portion of the tube is through the abdominal wall skin, the next point of resistance will be the bumper of the PEG tube passing through the tumor. In general, if a 5mm neonatal scope can pass the tumor, a 20Fr PEG tube can pass as well.\nThe tube is pulled into position and the measurement at the skin noted. The stomach is aspirated by the upper operator and insufflation is resumed at 8mmHg. Tension on the PEG tube is adjusted to allow apposition of the gastric serosa to the abdominal wall. If the tube is not easily apposed to the abdominal wall, T fasteners (“GI Anchors”) must be employed.\nThe scope is withdrawn and the hypopharynx suctioned. The liquid from the ‘First Step’ disinfectant is suctioned through the scope, followed by water.\nThe abdomen is desufflated and the port sites closed with 4-0 Monocryl.",

The right gastric artery is divided.\nCentral node dissection\nThe antrum is reflected to the patient’s left. Nodes are dissected from the common hepatic artery (Station 8), proximal splen artery (Station 11), and celiac axis (Station 9). The coronary vein is divided with the vessel sealer. The left gastric artery is triple-clipped. Dissection is now carried out posteriorly. The lesser curvature is cleared of lymph nodes (Stations 3) and right paracardial nodes (Station 1) taken depending upon tumor location.\nProximal division\nThe greater curvature is dissected proximally, typically taking several inferior short gastric vessels.

    "text": "16.4 Gastric Mobilization\n7cm upper midline incision for handport. Incision is centered over pylorus. GelPort inserted, and abdomen insufflated to 15mmHg. Two 5mm ports placed LUQ. Medial LUQ 5mm port placed in angle between left costal margin and superior edge of GelPort ring. Lateral LUQ 5mm port placed as far lateral as possible. Depending upon visualization, a third port may be required between these two and somewhat more inferior.\nIf feasible, division of gastrocolic omentum starts by delivering transverse colon into GelPort and dividing ligament with cautery and LigaSure in the avascular plane just cephalad to transverse colon. Dissection proceeds as far proximal and distal and feasible. It is important to avoid damage to the right gastroepiploic artery.\nColon is returned to abdomen and gastricolic ligament divided going using LigaSure, taking care to avoid the colon and the right gastroepiploic artery. For patients with a bulky omentum, it may be helpful to place an additional port in the left mid-quadrant for the camera to facilitate dissection of omentum off the transverse colon. Stomach is retracted to the patient’s right with the back of the left hand, placing the gastrocolic ligament (and short gastric arteries) on stretch. Left gastroepippoic artery divided with LigaSure near its origin. Short gastric arteries divided with Ligasure close to spleen. As superior aspect of short gastrics is reached, the dissection plane shifts medially to create a tunnel towards the base of the left crus. This places the most superior short gastric vessels on stretch and facilitates their division. Once all short gastric vessels divided, peritoneum tethering fundus to diaphragm is incised, and fundus brushed medially.\n\n16.4.1 Distal mobilization\nAttention is directed to mobilizing the lateral aspect of the duodenum. This can either be accomplished with the camera through a LUQ port and a 45 degree camera or by placing an additional 5mm port in the RLQ. Hook cautery is used to incise the connective tissue lateral and posterior to the duodenum. The gastrocolic ligament is now dissected distally, taking care to preserve the integrity of the right gastroepiploic vessels. An areolar plane generally exists between the fat pad containing the right gastroepiploic vessels and that containing the transverse mesocolon vessels.\n\n\n16.4.2 Left gastric artery\nLymph nodes around the celiac axis and left gastric artery are now dissected. The extend of dissection depends upon the tumor location and the presence of nodes her either based upon imaging or palpation. Dissection begins on the superior edge of the pancreas, and proceeds superiorly to the right crus. The left gastric (coronary) vein is usually located to the left of the arery and is divided with the LigaSure. In a two-phase approach, the left gastric artery is now divided with a 30mm gray load (2.0mm) Echelon linear stapler. For patients with mid-esophageal tumors, (for whom a four-phase approach is used), if there is any question about the resectability of the tumor, division of the left gastric gastric artery is generally deferred until the second abdominal phase.\n\n\n16.4.3 Mediastinal dissection\nThe esophagus is now dissected circumferentially at the gastroesophageal junction. The peritoneum overlying the diaphragm is incised, and circumferential dissection of esopahgus performed. On the left side, it is helpful to distract the left crus laterally with a Prestige clamp placed on the left crus The right pleura is widely entered in otder to both facilitate the thoracic dissection of the esophagus and placing the conduit into the right chest in preparation for the final thoracic phase. Division of Esophagus (Two-Phase only) In a four-phase approach, the esophagus is divided from the right chest during the first (of two) thoracic phases. In a two-phase approach, the esophagus is divided from the abdomen by reaching up into the mediastinum to divide the esophagus above the tumor. This is only feasible for tumors of the gastroesophageal junction. In a two-phase approach, the esophagus is divided with a 60mm Medium-Thich (Gold) Echelon TriStaple stapler.\n\n\n16.4.4 Division of Esophagus (Four-Phase)\nPenrose Drain (Four-Phase only) In a four-phase approach, the esophagus is divided from the chest. In order to facilitate the thoracic dissection, a 1/4″ penrose drain is tied around the distal esophagus and the drain is slid cephalad into the mediastinum. The ‘tails’ of the drain are directed into the right chest so that they can be grasped from the right chest during the thoracic phase and can be used to provide traction on the esophagus\n\n\n16.4.5 Entry into right chest\nThe pneumoperitoneum in the abdomen is vented and the gas pressure turned down to 8mmHg in preparation for the thoracic phase. The bed is rotated to the left 20 degrees. A site for entry in to the left chest is selected just posterior to the tip of the scapula. An incision is made here and a 5mm optical port with a 5mm 0 degree scope used to enter the chest. The chest is insufflated at 8mmHg of carbon dioxide, which helps to both copllapase the lung and depress the diaphragm. Two 12mm ports are placed. The more superior is placed lateral and superior to the nipple. The inferior port is placed just lateral to the diaphragmatic reflection. It is ciritcal to avoid injury to the diaphragm (and liver) with the inferior port placement. A mini-thoracotomy incision is placed along the mid-axillary line, frequently in the same interspace as the inferior/anterior 12mm port. The chest is entered just superior to the rib and the intercostal muscles divided with the LigaSure device to allow the ribs to separate. A narrow Deaver retractor is used to guage the space between the ribs, as the width of the retractor approximates the diameter of the 25mm stapler. A 5mm ‘U’ port is generally placed as high as possible midway between the scapular tip port and the anterior/superior 12mm port t0o the 4 right 5\nDivision of Esophagus (Two-Phase) In patients with low-lying tumors, it is possible to divide the esophagus above the tumor from the abdominal approach. This evaluation is facilitated by review of the properative endoscopy (and EUS), and the PET scan, particularly the PET obtained prior to neoadjuvant chemoradiation.\nAfter dissection of the mediastinum, a Echelon stapler with a 60mm Medium-Thick (Gold) load is inserted through a 12mm port either placed either through the GelPort or by upsizing the most lateral LUQ\nConstruction of Conduit The distal esophagus and stomach is exteriorized through the GelPort. The lesser curvature vessels are divided with the LigaSure 7-9cm cephalad from the pylorus. The stomach is now placed on stretch along the greater curvature. An Echelon Medium-Thick (Gold) stapler is used to construct a 5-6cm wide gastric tube. In constructing the conduit in a patient with a tumor of the GE jnction invading into the cardia, it is important to be certain that the staple line to construct the conduit stays clear of the tumor. Patients with tumors invading the cardia are at risk of a positive distal margin, meaning that microscopic tumor may be left in the wall of the gastric conduit. To make things more complicated, in patients with low-lying esophageal or GE junction tumors, not all of the length of the conduit are needed in order to reach to the level of the esophageal transection. After construction of the anastomosis, the ‘extra’ cephalad portion of the conduit (near the angle of His) are excised as the ‘additional gastric margin.’ In order to distinguish which portions of the conduit staple line which will be used to replace the esophagus and those which will be included in the ‘additional gastric margin’, both sides of the gastric conduit staple line are marked with sutures designated ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’, etc proceeding from the Angle of His to the antrum.\nThe distal esophagus and GE junction are now sent for frozen section.\nFeeding jejunostomy The ligament of Trietz is identified and the jejunum is identified 20cm distal and marked with a directional suture. A site is selected to the left of the handport incision. A 16Fr Cook Introducer Kit is used to pass a 16Ga needle, followed by a J wire, through the left rectus muscle. A skin incision 4mm in length is made adjacent to the J wire. The 16Fr dilator and sheath are now passed through the rectus muscle and the dilator and wire removed. A 14Fr Jejunostomy Tube 0301-14 is selected and the ‘wings’ trimmed off with a scalpel. The jejunostomy tube is passed through the peelaway sheath, which is removed.\nA pursestring suture 1.5cm in diameter is placed on the antimesenteric border of the jejunum. The pursestring is started and ends on the lateral aspect. A second 16Fr Cook Introduced Kit is used to introduce the J wire through the center of the pursestring.\nPlacement of Drains Two (or three) 19Fr full-fluted Blake drains (72230) are placed:\nJP1: placed into the left pleura through the hiatus. Drain is brought out through the most lateral 5mm port site on the LUQ JP2: placed into the right pleura through the hiatus. Drain is brought out through the next most medial 5mm LUQ port site JP3: (optional) placed in the abdomen posterior to the left lateral segment of the liver and brought out through the most medial 5mm LUQ port site Transposition of Conduit The gastric conduit is now placed into the right pleura through the mediastinum, with the assistance of a laparoscopic Babcock and gentle pressure on the greater curvature with the fingers.\nEntrance into the R chest (Two Phase) For two-phase operations, ports are now placed into the right chest, as stated above . In similar fashion, the inferior pulmonary ligament in dissected and the lung reflected anterior.\nAnastomosis The right chest is entered and the right lung reflected anterior with the paddle placed in the superior/anterior port. The gastric conduit is placed into the mediastinum by tucking it medially from the right pleura into the posterior mediastinum, in order to allow the conduit to take the most direct path from the hiatus to the proximal esophagus. Gentle superior tension is now applied to the conduit in order to eliminate redundancy. The paddle retractor is now moved from the anterior/inferior port to the anterior/superior 12mm port and the lung reflected anterior and inferior.\nOrVil The OrVil device is now used to place a EEA anvil into the distal esophagus. In general, a 25mm size is selected, unless the patient has particularly small frame, in which case a 21mm size is used. Two stay sutures of 2-0 silk on RB-1 needles are placed in the center of the esophageal staple line 3mm apart. A Harmonic scalpel is used to divide the staple line. The OrVil device is passed through the mouth and is passed through the fenestration in the staple line. The anvil portion of the OrVil is oriented so that the rounded portion is placed against the roof of the mouth. The OrVil is guided into the hypopharynx by pulling on the the tube end of the device. As the anvil approaches the hypopharynx, the jaw is pulled forward to allow passage of the anvil.\nThe shaft of the anvil is brought through the esophageal staple line, and the tube disconnected from the anvil by cutting the blue sutures.\nThe superior end of the conduit is opened along the staple line and the DST XL stapler (matching the diameter of the OrVil) introduced through the Alexis device. The stapler shaft is placed into the open end of the gastric conduit and the conduit pulled over it (‘sock over shoe’). The stapler spike is brought out through the greater curvature. The anvil is grasped with a Maryland grasper placed through a superior 5mm port and the two components of the stapler are mated and the stapler tightened and fired. The knob of the stapler is rotated two turns counter-clockwise until a click is felt, at which time the anvil will flip. The stapler is withdrawn and the donuts examined and sent for pathologic exam.\nThe anastomosis is completed by firing a Echelon Medium-Thick (Gold) linear) across the conduit cephalad to the anastomosis. The excess conduit is sent for pathologic exam as ‘additional gastric margin.’\nNG Tube A Covidien Salem Sump 18Fr nasogastric tube is passed by the anesthetist. A laparoscopic BK ultrasound is used to monitor the passage of the NG tube through the esophagus and into the gastric conduit. The NG tube is passed to the level that all for dots are outside the nose, with the 4th dot at the nares. The NG tube is secured with an AMT bridle.\nChest Tube A 28Fr Blake chest tube is placed through the anterior/inferior 12mm port and is positioned into the posterior mediastinum. JP2 is placed near the gastric conduit. The right lung is re-inflated.\nClosure The stapler access port incision is closed with 0 Vicryl to approximate the serratus muscle. The incisions are closed with 4-0 Monocryl followed by Dermabond.",

    "text": "22.1 Med Administration via J-Tubes\nDue to the osmotic load, jejunostomy feedings are given via enteral (Kangaroo) pump rather than bolus feeding. Feedings are generally begun as continuous (around-the-clock) and are then transitioned to nocturnal (generally 6pm to 10am) prior to discharge.\nJejunostomy feedings carry a small but significant risk (~1%) of small bowel necrosis, as evidenced by the findings of pneumatosis on CT scan and in some cases small bowel necrosis and perforation. The existing literature would suggest that the early symptoms associated with small bowel necrosis are abdominal distension. As a result, patients on jejunostomy tube feeding need to be carefully monitored for distension, and tube feeds held if distension develops.(Taylor et al. 2014) Tube feeds are generally started at 30mL/hour in the immediate postoperative patients. In patients who are awake and in whom it is possible to determine whether or not there are issues of tube feed intolerance, the rate of tube feedings is increased 10mL/hour every 12 hours to a goal of 60mL/hour for women and 75mL/hour for men. In patients who are intubated/sedated, the advancement of tube feeds is individualized, and decisions are made on a daily basis on rounds.\nFor patients who receive tube feedings preoperatively, the same formula is generally used after surgery.\nFor patients with BMI less than 35, Osmolite 1.5 is used as a starting formula. If Osmolite is not tolerated due to diarrhea, Vital 1.5 can be used. For patients with BMI greater than 35, Promote is used as a starting formula, as it contains a lower amount of carbohydrates then Osmolite 1.5. Patients who are intolerant to Promote can be switched to Vital High Protein.\nPatients less than 150 pounds receive 4 cans of tube feedings, administered at 60mL/hour x 16 hours (6pm to 10am). Patients greater than 150 pounds receive 5 cans of tube feedings, administered at 75mL/hour x 16 hours (6pm to 10am). Patients with BMI &gt;35 receive 5 cans of Promote (or Vital High Protein).\nGlucerna is formulated with carbohydrates with low glycemic index, which is particularly helpful for bolus feeding (via gastrostomy) or patients who are eating. Glycemic index is less important in patients on continuous tube feeds (eg via jejunostomy). In addition, the high fiber context of Glucerna may make this formula more prone to causing clogging of jejunostomy tubes. Free Water Flushes\nOnce patients are transferred to the ward, free water via jejunostomy should be ordered as 240mL via jejunostomy qid. This is entered under Flush Enteral Tube for Free Water Requirements. Diarrhea with Jejunostomy Feedings\nPatients who experience diarrhea during jejunostomy administration (especially diarrhea at night) will need this addressed. Several steps\nPatients who have difficulty with dysphagia or complete esophageal obstruction will need to have their medicines administered via jejunostomy tube.

    "text": "Inpt – Jejunostomy ~ Diabetes\nPatients on tube feeds are typically started on continuous (around-the-clock) tube feedings, and subsequently changed to a nocturnal regimen (typically 6pm to 10am). The diabetic management for these patients differs depending upon their tube feeding regimen:\nDiabetics on Continuous Tube Feeds.\nNon-insulin diabetic patients are generally initially given Osmolite 1.5 as it provides higher caloric density and does not contain fiber, which tends to clog the feeding tubes. Diabetic patients requiring insulin can be initially trialed on Osmolite 1.5 but are changed to Promote or Glucerna 1.5 if their blood sugars prove difficult to control (as evidence by either the need for EndoTool or requiring a q6 hour regimen of insulin N + insulin R).\nDiabetic patients who need insulin while receiving tube feedings are typically treated initially with continuous tube feedings and around-the-clock insulin. Patients with large insulin requirements may need hourly intravenous insulin (with dosages calculated via EndoTool). Once their insulin requirements are stabilized, they are transitioned to a q6 hour regimen consisting of N and R insulin, typically twice as many units of N insulin as R (for instance, 6Units of N + 3 Units of R insulin every six hours). Patients who require EndoTool or a q6hr regimen need an endocrinology consultation with Dr Kelli Dunn to assist in diabetic management.\nDiabetics on Nocturnal Tube Feeds\nMost patients are transitioned from continuous tube feeds to nocturnal prior to discharge. Diabetic patients on nocturnal tube feedings typically receive tube feeding from 6pm to 10am and receive insulin at initiation of tube feeds (6pm) and again at 6 hours later (midnight). A typical regimen might be 18U of 70/30 at 1800 and 18U of 70/30 at MN. An alternative might be 12U NPH + 6U Regular at 1800 and 16U NPH and 8U Regular insulin at MN. Because it can take several days to determine the correct insulin regimen, diabetic patients receiving jejunostomy feedings are cycled as early in their hospital course as possible to avoid delaying discharge for blood sugar management.\nDiabetic patients receiving insulin will need careful coordination of tube feeding and insulin administration when they are being transitioned from continuous to nocturnal tube feeds. Patients on continuous tube feeds may receive insulin on a q6 hour schedule, while those receiving nocturnal tube feeds receive insulin at 1800 and MN. When patients on continuous tube feeds are transitioned, the tube feeds are stopped at 10am, to be restarted at 6pm that evening. It is critical that as soon as the tube feeds are stopped at 10am, that the q6 hour insulin as stopped as well.\nIn either case it is critical that if tube feedings are stopped, standing insulin administration (either q6 hour OR 1800 and MN) be stopped as well. In these cases, sliding scale insulin is generally continued.\n\n\n\nDay\nTime\nTube Feeds\nInsulin\n\n\n\n\nSUN\nMN\n60mL/hr\n8N+4R\n\n\nMon\n6am\n60mL/hr\n8N+R\n\n\nMon\nNoon\nStop\nNone\n\n\nMon\n6pm\n75mL/hr\n16N + 8R\n\n\nMon\nMN\n75mL/hr\n16N+ 8R\n\n\nTues\n10am\nStop\nNone\n\n\nTues\n6pm\n75mL/hr\n16N+ 8R\n\n\nTues\nMN\n75mL/hr\n16N+ 8R\n\n\nWeds\n10am\nStop\nNone\n\n\n\nIn this example, the patient was receiving 8N + 4R every 6 hours, so total insulin units per day is (8+4) x 4 = 48units. Because the carbohydrate load of 60mL/hour x 24 is roughly equivalent to 75mL/hour x 16 hours, the total insulin administered is roughly the same. When converted to nocturnal dosing, the patient now received 16+8 = 24 units twice (6pm and MN) = 48U. In practice, it may be wiser to begin by adjusting the dose down a little, to perhaps 14U N and 7U R for the first night.",

For others, patients are given metoprolol 2.5 mg IV q6hrs which can be titrated up to 10mg IV q6hrs as needed. See STS Guidelines.​2​\nHome anti-hypertensives are usually held in order to allow beta-blockade. Patients who have elevated blood pressures once they are adequately beta-blocked (eg HR 60-70) are usually restarted on their home anti-hypertensives. Home anti-hypertensives are not routinely restarted postoperatively\nRespiratory\nChest X-ray on admission to ICU. Chest tubes generally consist of a 28Fr Blake drain placed into the right chest. This is placed to water seal when output is less than 200mL/day and there is no leak visible in the Pleurevac container. Chest tubes are usually removed once output is less than 150mL/day and drainage is clear without evidence of chyle (milky appearance).\nGastrointestinal All patients receive pantoprazole 40mg IV daily and metoclopramide 5-10mg IV q 6hrs\nNutrition\nAll esophagectomy patients receive a feeding jejunostomy at the time of operation. In the immediate post-operative period, patients receive Osmolite 1.5 starting the day of surgery once they are off pressors. Tube feeds are started at 20mL/hour until flatus and then advanced at 10mL per hour every 8 hours, up to a goal of 60mL per hour (x24 hours). Patients who are on tube feeds prior to surgery are generally restarted on their home tube feed formula.\nPatients who do not tolerate Osmolite are switched to Vital 1.5, which is pre-hydrolyzed. In order to allow enough time for switching of tube feedings, patients are generally switched from Vital to their home tube feeding formula 3-4 days prior to discharge. This is typically done when they are transferred out of the ICU.\nObese patients (BMI&gt;30) are started on Promote at 20mL/hour and increased to a goal of 60mL/hour. Promote contains a more protein relative to carbohydrdates. An alternative is Vital High Protein, which is similar to Promote but using hydrolyzed proteins.\nDiarrhea in patients on tube feeds (especially nocturnal diarrhea) needs to be addressed. Despite STICU guidelines for nutrition in trauma patients, diarrhea (especially night-time diarrhea) is justification for alteration in tube feeds. See Diarrhea and Jejunstomy Feeding\nDiabetic Patients\nPatients who require EndoTool in the ICU will need an endocrinology consult. See also Jejunostomy Feedings with Diabetes\n‘Free Water’\nIn addition to tube feeds, most patients will receive ‘free’ water flushes through the jejunostomy. This is typically done as 240mL four times per day (for a total of 32oz)\nNasogastric Tubes\nA silicone nasogastric tube (Covidien Salem Sump) is placed in all patients during surgery and the position confirmed by ultrasound intraoperatively. Tubes are positioned so that all 4 dots are outside. Gastric emptying is evaluated with upper GI prior to NG tube removal. Once extubated, upper GI is typically performed on the 2nd through 4th postoperative day. Conversely, patients who are intubated will keep their nasogastric tube until extubated. Radiology ordered as “upper GI Series”. In the comments section please add “IsoVue through NG tube. Contact Dr Salo for study”. See Evaluation of GI Function\nDrains\n\nJP1: 19Fr Blake drain in left pleura. The exit site the most lateral drain and is secured with a blue suture\nJP2: 19Fr Blake drain in right pleura. The exit site is medial to JP1 and is secured with a black suture\nJP3: 19 Fr Blake drain in abdomen. If used, the exit site is most medial and is secured with a blue suture\nJP4: 15Fr Blake drain in neck (for cervial incision)\nJP5: 15Fr Blake drain in subcutaneous tissue of incision\n\nEvaluation for Anastomotic leak\nDrain amylase is an inexpensive, specific, and relatively sensitive test for anastomotic leak. Fluid from JP2 (right chest) is sent for “Body Fluid Amylase” starting on postoperative day #4 and continued until postoperative day 9. Drain amylase over 400IU/ml is considered positive and prompts a CT esophagram for confirmation. See also Evaluation for Anastomotic Leak\nRenal Total fluids (IV + tube feeds) are generally run at 75mL/hour. Foley catheter is removed on the first or second day after surgery. Some patients will need diuresis on the 3rd or 4th postoperative day\nHeme All patients require VTE prophylaxis with Lovenox or heparin SQ.\nPreoperative anti-platelet agents are started on the first (aspirin) or second (Plavix) postoperative day if there is no excessive bleeding from the chest tube or JP drains. Patients on preoperative anticoagulation are transitioned to therapeutic Lovenox on the second postoperative day if no signs of bleeding.\nID Prophylactic Cefazolin and Flagyl are administered for 24 hours and stopped",

    "text": "25.4 Evaluation for leak\nExperience suggests that the median time to the diagnosis of leak is 7 day after surgery. Currently the risk of anastomotic leak at CMC after transthoracic esophagectomy is 2%. The most sensitive test for the diagnosis of leak is CT esophagram (see below). Based upon institutional experience, patients are divided into low risk of leak vs high risk for leak based upon drain amylase level and white blood cell count. Patients with a normal drain amylase (400IU/ml) between postoperative day 4 and day 7 AND white blood cell count less than 12 are considered low risk. Patients with either an elevated drain amylase or WBC greater than 12 are evaluated with CT esophagram. In a group of 100 patients, several were found to have elevated drain amylase in the first four days (up to 2000Iu/ml) which subsequently declined, and no evidence of leak was found\n\n25.4.1 Drain Amylase\nJP2 is placed into the right pleura, passes through the hiatus, and is brought out through a trocar site in the medial left upper quadrant. Drain amylase from JP2 is tested beginning on postoperative day #4 until discharge or postoperative day #9. JP2 is generally removed prior to patient discharge. JP1 is placed in the left pleura and is generally not tested for amylase.\n\n\n25.4.2 CT esophagram\nThis is the most sensitive study for the detection of anastomotic leak. In order to obtain sufficient sensitivity, it requires a pre-contrast scan and the administration of contrast into the esophagus. The need for a pre-contrast scan means that the presence of remnant barium in the esophagus (from a Modified Barium Swallow) makes it more difficult to interpret the scan and should be avoided. Awake patients can drink the contrast. Patients with an NG tube present at the time of the study generally will have contrast administered through their NG tube. Almost all esophagectomy patients will have a Covidien silicone Salem Sump 18Fr tube in place. This has four marks on the tube at 45, 55, 65, and 75cm. The tube is typically positioned with the 4th mark at the nares, which means that the tip is 45cm from the nares and is usually within the gastric conduit AND below the anastomosis. The NG tube also contains side holes which extend 8.5cm above the tip of the tube. The optimal study is done with the NG tube withdrawn so that there are two side-holes above the anastomosis, which means that the tip is approximately 5cm below the anastomosis. A scout CT will be performed, and the radiologist will determine how far back the NG tube needs to be withdrawn. This is communicated to the CT technician, who asks the nurse (or physician) to withdraw the tube the calculated amount (making a note of the starting position of the tube relative to the four marks). This should keep the tip below the level of the anastomosis, so that after the CT scan, the NG tube can be (blindly) advanced back to its original position (at approximately 45cm from the nares).\nPatients who clinically deteriorate prior to post-operative day 7 in whom there is high suspicion for a leak (fevers, pleural effusion on chest X-ray, elevated JP amylase, respiratory failure) will undergo a CT esophagram earlier than post-operative day 7.",

Conservative management will generally be successful for most patients with leaks provided 1) there is no evidence of conduit necrosis 2) nutrition is optimized and 3) empyema is treated. Patients with leaks may even need a decortication, which emphasizes the importance of CT scan in the sick post-operative esophagectomy patient, so that an empyema can be diagnosed and treated. Patients with leaks who show signs of systemic illness may need to be considered for an intraluminal stent.

Their current daily usage at the time of their first postop visit is estimated, and the first prescription plans for the same daily amount for a two week period. If they are taking 5mg of oxycodone 5 times per day, a prescription is prepared for 5 x 14 = 70 doses. The prescription is annotated “Two week supply at 5 doses per day”. Patients are told the prescription will be renewed 2 weeks later at a reduced dose (typically one fewer dose per day). If the oxycodone bottle is lost, patients are prescribed tramadol (50mg q6 hours). Patient are told that if they need long-term pain management, they will need the assistance of their primary care provider.\nPatients are instructed that they are not “cleared” for driving as long as they are taking oxycodone\nCardiovascular\nBeta blockers are used around the time of surgery to prevent atrial fibrillation. Management depends upon patients’s preoperative medications:\nPatients not on beta-blockers or antihypertensives prior to surgery are started on metoprolol 25 to 50mg enteral bid in the hospital. At their first postoperative visit, metoprolol is cut to once per day for one week, then stopped.\nPatients taking antihypertensives but not on beta-blockers prior to surgery are started on metoprolol 25 to 50mg enteral bid in the hospital.

At their first postoperative visit, metoprolol is discontinued and their home antihypertensives resumed.\nPatients taking beta-blockers are kept on their beta blockers in the hospital and after surgery\nIf patients have been experienced atrial fibrillation in the hospital or have new cardiac medicines, they will need cardiology follow up for management. Typically this is amiodarone.\nRespiratory\nPleural effusion (typically on the right) is a risk after esophagectomy. If the lung exam suggests a pleural effusion, a chest x-ray PA/Lateral can be obtained same-day in LCI I.\nChest incisions should be inspected for signs of wound infection and retained silk (black) suture at the chest tube site\nPatients who are hypoxemic should be further investigated with chest x-ray. Delayed pulmonary embolism would be unusual, but would need to be considered and evaluated with a CT angiogram.\nGI\nPatients who pass their modified barium swallow are discharged on protein shakes and water by mouth. They are advanced to a Phase I diet at their first post-operative visit.\nPatients who do not pass their modified barium swallow will need an outpatient MBS ordered at the first postop visit. They will continue with either 1) meds via J tube or 2) meds with thickened water, depending upon their MBS results in the hospital.\nSkin staples are removed, and the jejunostomy site inspected for infection. Infections are treated with Augmentin for 7-10 days. In some cases, infected cuffed jejunostomy tubes will need to be replaced in interventional radiology. See J tubes\nTube feeds are typically run for 16 hours nocturnal - 5 cartons for men (75mL/hour) and 4 cartons for women (60mL/hour). Free water is usually 240mL 4x/day.\nDiabetics on Tube Feeds receiving insulin require special management.\n70% of patient are taking oral liquids when discharged, including protein shakes. For patients that can get one Premier protein, this represents 30gm of protein, which is the equivalent of 2 cartons of tube feeds. These patients can often have their tube feeds decreased to 3 cartons/night, which allows them to run for only 12 hours.\nDiarrhea Loose stools during the day are to be expected, but diarrhea at night is problematic both for sleep and quality of life. This may require a change in formula from intact protein (Osmolite 1.5) to a peptide formula (Vital 1.5).

In this case, the insulin dosage could be kept the same at the start of tube feeds, BUT the dose 6 hours after the start of tube feeds could be omitted.\nOnce patients are on 3 cans per night, further weaning can be accomplished by skipping tube feeds (and insulin) every other night in a “tube feed holiday”.

Tumors &lt;3cm in length are much more likely to represent T1-2 lesions than those \\(\\geq\\) 3cm(Hollis et al. 2017). For these patients, determining the precise T stage is important in their workup, so endoscopic ultrasound is the most frequent staging study after diagnosis.\nPatients who present with dysphagia are likely to have T3 or T4 disease, which is generally treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery. Data from Memorial Sloan Kettering (Ripley et al. 2016) among 61 patients with esophageal cancer who presented with dysphagia, 54 (89%) were found on EUS to have uT3-4 tumors. On the other hand, among 53 patients without dysphagia, 25 (47%) were uT1-2, and were potentially candidates for primary surgery. Their conclusion was that EUS could be omitted from the workup of patients with dysphagia, but is useful in patients without dysphagia.\nPET can be helpful in evaluating patients who may have T1-2 disease, and might be candidates for primary surgical therapy. A comparison of PET and EUS (Malik et al. 2017) showed that uT1-2 tumors had median metabolic tumor volume (MTV) of 6.7cm3, compared with uT3-4 tumors, with a median MTV of 35.7cm3.\n\n\n\n\nHollis, Alexander C., Lauren M.

In other words, if a patient who is thought to have cT2N0 disease undergoes resection, and is found on pathology to have pT3 or pN+ disease, this would dictate the need for postoperative chemoradiation. In general, chemoradiation after esophagectomy is difficult for patients to tolerate, with a 40 % chance of failure to complete therapy.\nData from the Cleveland Clinic looked at 53 patients judged to be T2N0 by endoscopic ultrasound (uT2N0) were treated with primary surgery. Pathologic examination showed that 17 (37%) were understaged by endoscopic ultrasound, and were pathologic (pT3) in 4 or node positive (pN+) in 13 cases. These patients were treated with postoperative adjuvant chemoradiation.(Rice et al. 2007)\nIt is critical, therefore, in patients for whom primary surgery is contemplated, to attempt to identify those with occult T3 or N+ disease.\n\n34.3.1 PET for staging of early-stage esophageal cancer\n86 patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma (Mantziari et al. 2020) evaluated with PET: clinical T3/T4 was significantly predicted by SUVmax 8.25, Total Lesion Glycolysis &gt;42 and Metabolic Tumor Volume &gt; 10cm3\nSee also PMID:25047477\n(MTV)\nCohort of patients treated with primary surgery: risk factors for clinical understaging are dsyphagia, poor differentiation, and tumor length &gt;3cm (Worrell et al. 2018)",

    "text": "35.1 Trimodality Therapy\nTumors that are T2N+M0 or T3NxM0 are considered locally-advanced. The high rate of failure with surgery alone has led to development of adjunctive therapies.\nTrimodality therapy consists of chemoradiation (chemoRT) followed by surgery. Between 2010 and early 2024, this approach was the standard of care for locally-advanced esophageal cancer. In 2024, the ESOPEC trial showed superior survival for adenocarcinoma with perioperative “sandwich” FLOT chemotherapy compared to chemoRT. For squamous cell carcinoma, trimodality therapy continues to be the standard of care.\nCROSS trial randomized 364 patients with resectable esophageal and gastroesophageal junction tumors (75% adenocarcinoma) to neoadjuvant chemoradiation consisting of 4,140 cGy of radiation with concurrent carboplatin and paclitaxel or surgery alone.(Hagen et al. 2012) Clinical node-positive disease was present in 16%. Pathologic complete response was seen in 23% of adenocarcinoma and 49% of squamous cell carcinomas. Median overall survival was 49 months after trimodality vs 24 months after surgery alone (p=0.003). Survival at 5 years was 47% with trimodality vs 34% with surgery alone. Squamous cell carcinomas appeared to have particular benefit, with a hazard ratio of 0.42 for squamous cell vs 0.74 for adenocarcinoma. Median survival was improved for adenocarcinoma from 27.1 months to 43.2 months, but the median survival for squamous cell increased from 27.1months to 81.6 months for squamous cell. Rate of R0 resection was higher with chemoradiation (92% vs 69% p&lt;0.001) and local recurrence rates lower (14% vs 34% P&lt;0.001), and peritoneal recurrence lower (4% vs 14% P&lt;0.001). Despite the relatively low dose of radiation, in-field recurrences were less than 5%. The primary cause of failure was distant disease (31%) and local/regional failure (14%). Therapy was well-tolerated with 17% grade 3 toxicity.(Oppedijk et al. 2014)\nTen-year followup of the CROSS trial (Eyck et al. 2021) showed that the primary benefit of CROSS regimen was in reducing local and loco-regional recurrences. There was no difference in isolated distant recurrence betwee the two arms.\nAlternative to carboTaxol for chemoradiation is FOLFOX (SOG trial (Leichman et al. 2011))\nOngoing PROTECT trial compares FOLFOX to paclitaxel and carboplatin (Messager et al. 2016)\nSee also Definitive ChemoRT",

FLOT resulted in superior 3-year survival (57% vs 51%). Pathologic CR rate 16.7% vs 10%. Grade 3 toxicity 58% vs 50%. 90-day mortality 3.1% with FLOT vs 5.6% CROSS. pCR rate was much lower than original CROSS trial (23%). Notably, patients with an incomplete pathologic response after CROSS (90%) did not receive adjvant nivolumab, which has since become the standard of care due to the Checkmate 577 trial(Kelly et al. 2021).\nPOET Trial (Pre-Operative therapy in Esophageal adenocarcinoma Trial) treated 119 patients with adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction with either neoadjuvant chemotherapy (5-FU, leucovorin, cisplatin) followed by surgery or induction chemotherapy with the same agents, followed by chemoradiation (4000cGy with concurrent cisplatin and etoposide). The study suffered from slow accrual, but there was a suggestion of improved 3-year survival with preoperative chemoradiation (47.4% vs 27.7% p=0.07) as well as better local control (76.5% vs 59%). In addition, chemoradiation was associated with a higher pathologic complete response rate (15.6% vs 2%)(Stahl et al. 2009).\nNeo-AEGIS Trial (Reynolds et al. 2017) Randomized patients with GE junction adenocarcinomas to CROSS vs modified MAGIC (prior to 2018) or FLOT (after 2018).

    "text": "37.2 ChemoRT vs Trimodality therapy\nThe sensitivity of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus to chemoradiation has raised the question whether\nStahl Locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma randomized to induction chemotherapy (cisplatin, etopiside, 5FU with leuocovrin) followed by chemoradiation (4000cGy with concurrent ciplatin and etopiside) followed by surgery compared with induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation (6400cGy with concurrent cisplatin and etopiside).(Stahl et al. 2005) progression-free survival was better in the trimodality group (64.3% vs 40.7%) Treatment-related morality was substantial in the surgery arm (13% vs 4%). This would be considered an excessive rate of operative mortality by modern standards. Unsurprisingly, there was no difference in overall survival between groups, in part because the surgical group had an excess 9% mortality rate from treatment. Two-year survival in the surgery arm was 40% vs 35% in the definitive chemoradiation arm.\nIn the French FFCD trial, 444 patients with carcinoma of the esophagus (90% squamous cell) were treated with two cycles of 5-FU and cisplatin with concurrent radiation.(Bedenne et al. 2007) Patients with a partial or complete clinical response to chemoradiation were randomized to either surgery or a boost of radiation. Patients who did not respond to chemoradiation were treated with surgery and were eliminated from the study. Only 259 of the original 444 patients (59%) went on to randomization, with the remainder (those not responding to chemoradiation) treated with surgery. Of the randomized group, median survival was 17.7months in the surgery arm versus 19.3months in the definitive chemoradiation arm. Like the Stahl study, treatment-related mortality in the surgical arm was high (9% versus 1%).",

    "text": "40.0.1 Trans-thoracic vs Transhiatal Esophagectomy\nThree general approaches exist for surgical therapy.\nTrans-thoracic or Ivor Lewis esophagectomy(Visbal et al. 2001) removes the intrathoracic portion of the esophagus and constructs an anastomosis within the chest. The approach include an abdominal phase, during which an esophageal substitute is constructed (usually from stomach). A thoracic phase then removes the intrathoracic esophagus and constructs an anastomosis within the chest cavity.\nA McKeown esophagectomy utilizes three surgical fields: abdomen, right chest, and neck. The right chest approach allows dissection of peri-esophageal lymph nodes, and the cervical incision allows removal of the total esophagus.(McKeown 1976) This approach is useful for tumors which involve the proximal thoracic esophagus, to ensure a negative margin. The cervical anastomosis carries a higher risk of anastomotic leak than a thoracic anastomosis, although the morbidity of a cervical anastomosis leak is less serious than that of a leak of a thoracic anastomosis.\nA transhiatal esohpagectomy approaches the esophagus from the abdomen through the hiatus and from neck. By blunt dissection the esophagus is freed up without the need for thoracotomy. An esophageal substute is then brought from the abdomen to the neck through the mediastinum.(M. B. Orringer and Sloan 1978) (Mark B. Orringer et al. 2007) The operation is designed to avoid the pulmonary toxicity of the right chest approach. On the other hand, the blunt nature of the mediastinal dissection means that fewer lymph nodes are harvested than with a trans-thoracic approach.\nRandomized trial of transthoracic esophagectomy with extended lymph node dissection versus transhiatal esohpagectomy showed fewer pulmonary complications with the transhiatal approach. (Hulscher et al. 2002) Fewer lymph nodes were havested with a transhiatal appraoch. A post-hoc analysis showed that among patients with 1-8 positive lymph nodes, survival with improved with the extended lymph node dissection.(Omloo et al. 2007)\nMinimally-invasive approaches to esophagectomy are now common, with evidence for less perioperative morbidity than an open approach (Biere et al. 2012) (Zhou et al. 2015)\nRandomized trial of a hybrid MIE (with laparoscopy and thoracotomy) was associated with lower postoperative complications than open esophagectomy (Mariette et al. 2019)\nHigh volume centers have lower mortality for esophageal cancer than low-volume centers. (Birkmeyer et al. 2003) (Wouters et al. 2009)\nDutch randomized trial (n=262) cervical vs thoracic anastomosis.(Workum et al. 2021) Thoracic anastomosis associated with lower leak rate (12% vs 34%) and lower rate of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury (0% vs 7.3% ) and better quality of life (dysphagia, choking while swallowing, and talking)",

    "text": "43.1 Surveillance for CDH1 carriers\nCancer surveillance as an alternative to prophylactic total gastrectomy in hereditary diffuse gastric cancer: a prospective cohort study Bilal Asif, Amber Leila Sarvestani, Lauren A Gamble, Sarah G Samaranayake, Amber L Famiglietti, Grace-Ann Fasaye, Martha Quezado, Markku Miettinen, Louis Korman, Christopher Koh, Theo Heller, Jeremy L Davis Summary Background Loss of function variants in CDH1 are the most frequent cause of hereditary diffuse gastric cancer. Endoscopy is regarded as insufficient for early detection due to the infiltrative phenotype of diffuse-type cancers. Microscopic foci of invasive signet ring cells are pathognomonic of CDH1 and precede development of diffuse gastric cancer. We aimed to assess the safety and effectiveness of endoscopy for cancer interception in individuals with germline CDH1 variants, particularly in those who declined prophylactic total gastrectomy. Methods In this prospective cohort study, we included asymptomatic patients aged 2 years or older with pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline CDH1 variants who underwent endoscopic screening and surveillance at the National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD, USA) as part of a natural history study of hereditary gastric cancers (NCT03030404). Endoscopy was done with non-targeted biopsies and one or more targeted biopsy and assessment of focal lesions. Endoscopy findings, pathological data, personal and family cancer history, and demographics were recorded. Procedural morbidity, gastric cancer detection by endoscopy and gastrectomy, and cancer-specific events were assessed. Screening was defined as the initial endoscopy and all subsequent endoscopies were considered surveillance; follow-up endoscopy was at 6 to 12 months. The primary aim was to determine effectiveness of endoscopic surveillance for detection of gastric signet ring cell carcinoma. Findings Between Jan 25, 2017, and Dec 12, 2021, 270 patients (median age 46·6 years [IQR 36·5–59·8], 173 [64%] female participants, 97 [36%] male participants; 250 [93%] were non-Hispanic White, eight [3%] were multiracial, four [2%] were non-Hispanic Black, three [1%] were Hispanic, two [1%] were Asian, and one [&lt;1%] was American Indian or Alaskan Native) with germline CDH1 variants were screened, in whom 467 endoscopies were done as of data cutoff (April 30, 2022). 213 (79%) of 270 patients had a family history of gastric cancer, and 176 (65%) reported a family history of breast cancer. Median follow-up was 31·1 months (IQR 17·1–42·1). 38 803 total gastric biopsy samples were obtained, of which 1163 (3%) were positive for invasive signet ring cell carcinoma. Signet ring cell carcinoma was detected in 76 (63%) of 120 patients who had two or more surveillance endoscopies, of whom 74 had occult cancer detected; the remaining two individuals developed focal ulcerations each corresponding to pT3N0 stage carcinoma. 98 (36%) of 270 patients proceeded to prophylactic total gastrectomy. Among patients who had a prophylactic total gastrectomy after an endoscopy with biopsy samples negative for cancer (42 [43%] of 98), multifocal stage IA gastric carcinoma was detected in 39 (93%). Two (1%) participants died during follow-up, one due to metastatic lobular breast cancer and the other due to underlying cerebrovascular disease, and no participants were diagnosed with advanced stage (III or IV) cancer during follow-up. Interpretation In our cohort, endoscopic cancer surveillance was an acceptable alternative to surgery in individuals with CDH1 variants who declined total gastrectomy.
