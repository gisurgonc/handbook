    "text": "8.3 Postop Care after esophagectomy\n\n8.3.1 Beta blockade and anti-hypertensives\nAtrial fibrillation occurs in the postoperative period in 20% of patients. For this reason, beta blockers are used to atrial fibrillation prevention. In the ICU, metoprolol is administered intravenously and is subsequently changed to enteral administration. Because metoprolol also lowers blood pressure, patients on home anti-hypertensives frequently have them held during their hospital stay (and after discharge). At the first postoperative visit, patients who were not treated with beta blockade preoperatively are generally switched from metoprolol back to their home anti-hypertensives.\n\n\n8.3.2 Weaning Tube Feeds in Diabetics\nAs outpatients begin eating more orally, their tube feeds are reduced.\nWeaning from 5 cans to 4 cans: Easiest method is to maintain the same schedule (16 hours) and reduce insulin dosage by 20%. For instance, the above patient who is on 5 cans at 75mL/hour x 16 hours is receiving 16N + 8R at start of tube feeds and 6 hours later. This patient could be weaned by reducing rate form 75mL/hour x 16 hours to 60mL/hour x 16 hours and reducing insulin to 12N + 6R at the start of tube feeds AND another dose of 12N + 6R after 6 hours.\nWeaning from 4 cans to 3 cans: One option is to decrease the duration of tube feeds from 16 hours to 12 hours, while maintaining rate of 60mL/hour. In this case, the insulin dosage could be kept the same at the start of tube feeds, BUT the dose 6 hours after the start of tube feeds could be omitted.\nOnce patients are on 3 cans per night, further weaning can be accomplished by skipping tube feeds (and insulin) every other night in a “tube feed holiday”. This allows an evening of interrupted sleep and can tend to increase the appetite the morning after tube feeds are held.",

Patients with metastatic esophageal cancer who need enteral access are generally treated with a gastrostomy, which does not require feeding with a pump\nPreop (Resident) Preop orderset: search for “Jejunostomy”\nReview Clinical Information (Resident) Review staging scans (especially PET scan) to identify suspicious areas on imaging which need to be investigated at the time of laparoscopy Outpatient anticoagulation use (warfarin, Xaralto, aspirin, Plavix) Review dietitian’s recommendations (how many cans of feeding per day?) If patient is scheduled for central venous port Confirm that a port has not already been placed Prior history of central venous lines? Confirm location of port placement with surgeon (left vs right)\nOperation\nIf a central venous port is placed, the port is performed first. See IJ Port\nAbdominal access is obtained in one of two ways:\nInfraumbilical approach using modified Hasson technique. If the peritoneum is not easily entered, a Veress needle is used to insufflate, followed by incision of the fascia with a 15 blade, and a 5mm optical port (Applied Medical Kii Fios First Entry Z-Thread Trocar) Veress needle inserted in LEFT upper quadrant just inferior to costal margin. Abdominal entry with 5mm optical Z-Thread port. 5mm port in right upper quadrant, 5mm port in RLQ just lateral to rectus, 5mm camera port between RUQ and RLQ ports\nThe transverse colon is now elevated (using the umbilical port, if used) and the ligament of Treitz is identified. The proximal bowel is arranged in a “C” configuration to confirm the proximal and distal ends of bowel.\nA site for placement of the jejunostomy is selected on the skin, left lateral and just superior to the umbilicus. A site is selected on the bowel in the most proximal site on the jejunostomy selected which would allow for placement of the jejunostomy without tension, but at least 20cm from ligament of Treitz.\nThe proximal jejunum is sutured to the anterior abdominal wall with 2-0 silk. This is usually done with a 9″ suture which is introduced into the abdomen with a needle driver “Korean Style” or “Paraguayan Style.” Two cm distal to this suture, a diamond of sutures is placed around the proposed tube site, and one suture placed distal to avoid torsion. The final arrangement of sutures is one proximal and one distal and 4-6 sutures around the tube. All sutures were marked with hemostatic clips to facilitate replacement of the tube via fluoroscopy should the tube become dislodged.\nUsing Seldinger technique, a 16Fr Cook catheter introducer kit is placed within the jejunum.\nA MIC 14Fr jejunostomy tube (0301-14) with the tabs trimmed with a scalpel, is inserted through the sheath and positioned in the jejunum. The tube was secured with a suture of 0 silk.\nIf a balloon tube is used, an 18Fr Cook dilater and sheath is used, followed by a MIC 14Fr jejunustomy tube (0200-14) and the balloon inflated with 7mL of sterile WATER.\nThe tube is secured with 0 silk and dressed with a BioPatch and a Tagederm dressing.\nThe abdomen is desufflated and the port sites closed with 4-0 Monocryl, followed by dermabond.\nAfter dressings are applied, a Lopez valve is attached with the long Christmas-tree end placed into the jejunostomy tube.\nEndoscopy The scope is set up:\nSuction and aspiration valves inserted and working Suction tubing attached Biopsy valve attached and not leaking Cart set up for recording by powering on the Stryker SDC digital capture box A bite block is used and the scope lubricated. A neonatal scope may be necessary in patients with a tight stricture. Important findings to record:\nLevel in cm from the incisors, of the most proximal area of Barrett’s esophagus. Level in cm from the incisors of the GE junction Appearance of the GE junction on retroflexed view. Extent of invasion of the tumor into the cardia or fundus.

See IJ Port\nAbdominal access is obtained in one of two ways:\n\nVeress needle inserted in left upper quadrant just inferior to costal margin. Abdominal entry with 5mm optical port at lateral border of rectus just superior to umbilicus\nInfraumbilical approach using modified Hasson technique. If the peritoneum is not easily entered, a Veress needle is used to insufflate, followed by incision of the fascia with a 15 blade, and a 5mm optical port\n\nThe insufflation pressure is decreased to 4mmHg and the abdomen vented to drop the pressure. A 30 degree scope is passed inferior to the falciform ligament into the left upper quadrant over the lateral segment of liver. The post of the scope is positioned to the left, allowing visualization of the lesser curvature of the stomach with the end of the scope near the left aspect of the falciform.\nA site for placement of the gastrostomy is selected on the skin, using a 22Ga needle as a finder. The site is marked, then infiltrated with local anesthetic and a 5mm transverse incision made.\nEndoscopy is performed and the following noted:\nLevel in cm from the incisors, of the most proximal area of Barrett’s esophagus. Level in cm from the incisors of the GE junction Appearance of the GE junction on retroflexed view. Extent of invasion of the tumor into the cardia or fundus.\nA bite block is positioned (unless the patient is edentulous). The endoscope (usually a neonatal scope) is introduced into the esophagus and the video capture started. If the tumor will not allow passage of the scope, do not force the scope.\nOnce the scope is passed into the stomach, the fundus and duodenal bulb are suctioned.\nInsufflation is then reduced to 4mm and the stomach insufflated to find the optimal location for tube placement which will minimize tension and will avoid injury to the right gastroepiploic artery. The reduced laparoscopic insufflation pressure allows endoscopic insufflation of the stomach.\nGastrostomy tube placement is done either by Pull or Seldinger technique.\nSeldinger Gastrostomy\nFour T-fasteners are then used to affix the stomach to the anterior abdominal wall. These are arranged at 8:00, 10:00, 2:00, 4:00 relative to the proposed tube site. T-fasteners are not placed inferior to the tube site to avoid injury to right gastroepiploic vessels.\nThe J wire is then passed into the stomach, followed by the dilators, up to 20Fr. A 16Fr MIC gastrostomy tube is introduced and the balloon inflated with 5mL of water.\nPull Gastrostomy\nA 20Fr PULL PEG tube kit is opened. The snare and tube are passed to the upper operator. The snare is passed through the scope and opened in anticipation of the passage of the wire.\nThe angiocath from the kit is placed into the stomach through the abdominal wall. Once the snare has grasped the angiocath, the needle is withdrawn and the split wire passed through the Angiocath into the stomach. The snare is adjusted to grasp the split wire, which is pulled out through the mouth.\nThe laparoscopic port site is considered clean. The PEG tube, once it is pulled through the mouth, is considered dirty. The right abdomen is covered with a towel to protect the laparoscopic site.\nThe recording is now stopped. The split wire is joined to the PEG tube, which is pulled into place by the abdominal operator. The tapered portion of the tube will be the first source of resistance, which may require firm traction. The split wire (and PEG tube) is dropped of the table to the patient’s left.\nOnce the tapered portion of the tube is through the abdominal wall skin, the next point of resistance will be the bumper of the PEG tube passing through the tumor. In general, if a 5mm neonatal scope can pass the tumor, a 20Fr PEG tube can pass as well.\nThe tube is pulled into position and the measurement at the skin noted. The stomach is aspirated by the upper operator and insufflation is resumed at 8mmHg. Tension on the PEG tube is adjusted to allow apposition of the gastric serosa to the abdominal wall. If the tube is not easily apposed to the abdominal wall, T fasteners (“GI Anchors”) must be employed.\nThe scope is withdrawn and the hypopharynx suctioned. The liquid from the ‘First Step’ disinfectant is suctioned through the scope, followed by water.\nThe abdomen is desufflated and the port sites closed with 4-0 Monocryl.",

    "section": "14.4 Gastric Mobilization",
    "text": "14.4 Gastric Mobilization\n7cm upper midline incision for handport. Incision is centered over pylorus. GelPort inserted, and abdomen insufflated to 15mmHg. Two 5mm ports placed LUQ. Medial LUQ 5mm port placed in angle between left costal margin and superior edge of GelPort ring. Lateral LUQ 5mm port placed as far lateral as possible. Depending upon visualization, a third port may be required between these two and somewhat more inferior.\nIf feasible, division of gastrocolic omentum starts by delivering transverse colon into GelPort and dividing ligament with cautery and LigaSure in the avascular plane just cephalad to transverse colon. Dissection proceeds as far proximal and distal and feasible. It is important to avoid damage to the right gastroepiploic artery.\nColon is returned to abdomen and gastricolic ligament divided going using LigaSure, taking care to avoid the colon and the right gastroepiploic artery. For patients with a bulky omentum, it may be helpful to place an additional port in the left mid-quadrant for the camera to facilitate dissection of omentum off the transverse colon. Stomach is retracted to the patient’s right with the back of the left hand, placing the gastrocolic ligament (and short gastric arteries) on stretch. Left gastroepippoic artery divided with LigaSure near its origin. Short gastric arteries divided with Ligasure close to spleen. As superior aspect of short gastrics is reached, the dissection plane shifts medially to create a tunnel towards the base of the left crus. This places the most superior short gastric vessels on stretch and facilitates their division. Once all short gastric vessels divided, peritoneum tethering fundus to diaphragm is incised, and fundus brushed medially.\n\n14.4.1 Distal mobilization\nAttention is directed to mobilizing the lateral aspect of the duodenum. This can either be accomplished with the camera through a LUQ port and a 45 degree camera or by placing an additional 5mm port in the RLQ. Hook cautery is used to incise the connective tissue lateral and posterior to the duodenum. The gastrocolic ligament is now dissected distally, taking care to preserve the integrity of the right gastroepiploic vessels. An areolar plane generally exists between the fat pad containing the right gastroepiploic vessels and that containing the transverse mesocolon vessels.\n\n\n14.4.2 Left gastric artery\nLymph nodes around the celiac axis and left gastric artery are now dissected. The extend of dissection depends upon the tumor location and the presence of nodes her either based upon imaging or palpation. Dissection begins on the superior edge of the pancreas, and proceeds superiorly to the right crus. The left gastric (coronary) vein is usually located to the left of the arery and is divided with the LigaSure. In a two-phase approach, the left gastric artery is now divided with a 30mm gray load (2.0mm) Echelon linear stapler. For patients with mid-esophageal tumors, (for whom a four-phase approach is used), if there is any question about the resectability of the tumor, division of the left gastric gastric artery is generally deferred until the second abdominal phase.\n\n\n14.4.3 Mediastinal dissection\nThe esophagus is now dissected circumferentially at the gastroesophageal junction. The peritoneum overlying the diaphragm is incised, and circumferential dissection of esopahgus performed. On the left side, it is helpful to distract the left crus laterally with a Prestige clamp placed on the left crus The right pleura is widely entered in otder to both facilitate the thoracic dissection of the esophagus and placing the conduit into the right chest in preparation for the final thoracic phase. Division of Esophagus (Two-Phase only) In a four-phase approach, the esophagus is divided from the right chest during the first (of two) thoracic phases. In a two-phase approach, the esophagus is divided from the abdomen by reaching up into the mediastinum to divide the esophagus above the tumor. This is only feasible for tumors of the gastroesophageal junction. In a two-phase approach, the esophagus is divided with a 60mm Medium-Thich (Gold) Echelon TriStaple stapler.\n\n\n14.4.4 Division of Esophagus (Four-Phase)\nPenrose Drain (Four-Phase only) In a four-phase approach, the esophagus is divided from the chest. In order to facilitate the thoracic dissection, a 1/4″ penrose drain is tied around the distal esophagus and the drain is slid cephalad into the mediastinum. The ‘tails’ of the drain are directed into the right chest so that they can be grasped from the right chest during the thoracic phase and can be used to provide traction on the esophagus\n\n\n14.4.5 Entry into right chest\nThe pneumoperitoneum in the abdomen is vented and the gas pressure turned down to 8mmHg in preparation for the thoracic phase. The bed is rotated to the left 20 degrees. A site for entry in to the left chest is selected just posterior to the tip of the scapula. An incision is made here and a 5mm optical port with a 5mm 0 degree scope used to enter the chest. The chest is insufflated at 8mmHg of carbon dioxide, which helps to both copllapase the lung and depress the diaphragm. Two 12mm ports are placed. The more superior is placed lateral and superior to the nipple. The inferior port is placed just lateral to the diaphragmatic reflection. It is ciritcal to avoid injury to the diaphragm (and liver) with the inferior port placement. A mini-thoracotomy incision is placed along the mid-axillary line, frequently in the same interspace as the inferior/anterior 12mm port. The chest is entered just superior to the rib and the intercostal muscles divided with the LigaSure device to allow the ribs to separate. A narrow Deaver retractor is used to guage the space between the ribs, as the width of the retractor approximates the diameter of the 25mm stapler. A 5mm ‘U’ port is generally placed as high as possible midway between the scapular tip port and the anterior/superior 12mm port t0o the 4 right 5\nDivision of Esophagus (Two-Phase) In patients with low-lying tumors, it is possible to divide the esophagus above the tumor from the abdominal approach. This evaluation is facilitated by review of the properative endoscopy (and EUS), and the PET scan, particularly the PET obtained prior to neoadjuvant chemoradiation.\nAfter dissection of the mediastinum, a Echelon stapler with a 60mm Medium-Thick (Gold) load is inserted through a 12mm port either placed either through the GelPort or by upsizing the most lateral LUQ\nConstruction of Conduit The distal esophagus and stomach is exteriorized through the GelPort. The lesser curvature vessels are divided with the LigaSure 7-9cm cephalad from the pylorus. The stomach is now placed on stretch along the greater curvature. An Echelon Medium-Thick (Gold) stapler is used to construct a 5-6cm wide gastric tube. In constructing the conduit in a patient with a tumor of the GE jnction invading into the cardia, it is important to be certain that the staple line to construct the conduit stays clear of the tumor. Patients with tumors invading the cardia are at risk of a positive distal margin, meaning that microscopic tumor may be left in the wall of the gastric conduit. To make things more complicated, in patients with low-lying esophageal or GE junction tumors, not all of the length of the conduit are needed in order to reach to the level of the esophageal transection. After construction of the anastomosis, the ‘extra’ cephalad portion of the conduit (near the angle of His) are excised as the ‘additional gastric margin.’ In order to distinguish which portions of the conduit staple line which will be used to replace the esophagus and those which will be included in the ‘additional gastric margin’, both sides of the gastric conduit staple line are marked with sutures designated ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’, etc proceeding from the Angle of His to the antrum.\nThe distal esophagus and GE junction are now sent for frozen section.\nFeeding jejunostomy The ligament of Trietz is identified and the jejunum is identified 20cm distal and marked with a directional suture. A site is selected to the left of the handport incision. A 16Fr Cook Introducer Kit is used to pass a 16Ga needle, followed by a J wire, through the left rectus muscle. A skin incision 4mm in length is made adjacent to the J wire. The 16Fr dilator and sheath are now passed through the rectus muscle and the dilator and wire removed. A 14Fr Jejunostomy Tube 0301-14 is selected and the ‘wings’ trimmed off with a scalpel. The jejunostomy tube is passed through the peelaway sheath, which is removed.\nA pursestring suture 1.5cm in diameter is placed on the antimesenteric border of the jejunum. The pursestring is started and ends on the lateral aspect. A second 16Fr Cook Introduced Kit is used to introduce the J wire through the center of the pursestring.\nPlacement of Drains Two (or three) 19Fr full-fluted Blake drains (72230) are placed:\nJP1: placed into the left pleura through the hiatus. Drain is brought out through the most lateral 5mm port site on the LUQ JP2: placed into the right pleura through the hiatus. Drain is brought out through the next most medial 5mm LUQ port site JP3: (optional) placed in the abdomen posterior to the left lateral segment of the liver and brought out through the most medial 5mm LUQ port site Transposition of Conduit The gastric conduit is now placed into the right pleura through the mediastinum, with the assistance of a laparoscopic Babcock and gentle pressure on the greater curvature with the fingers.\nEntrance into the R chest (Two Phase) For two-phase operations, ports are now placed into the right chest, as stated above . In similar fashion, the inferior pulmonary ligament in dissected and the lung reflected anterior.\nAnastomosis The right chest is entered and the right lung reflected anterior with the paddle placed in the superior/anterior port. The gastric conduit is placed into the mediastinum by tucking it medially from the right pleura into the posterior mediastinum, in order to allow the conduit to take the most direct path from the hiatus to the proximal esophagus. Gentle superior tension is now applied to the conduit in order to eliminate redundancy. The paddle retractor is now moved from the anterior/inferior port to the anterior/superior 12mm port and the lung reflected anterior and inferior.\nOrVil The OrVil device is now used to place a EEA anvil into the distal esophagus. In general, a 25mm size is selected, unless the patient has particularly small frame, in which case a 21mm size is used. Two stay sutures of 2-0 silk on RB-1 needles are placed in the center of the esophageal staple line 3mm apart. A Harmonic scalpel is used to divide the staple line. The OrVil device is passed through the mouth and is passed through the fenestration in the staple line. The anvil portion of the OrVil is oriented so that the rounded portion is placed against the roof of the mouth. The OrVil is guided into the hypopharynx by pulling on the the tube end of the device. As the anvil approaches the hypopharynx, the jaw is pulled forward to allow passage of the anvil.\nThe shaft of the anvil is brought through the esophageal staple line, and the tube disconnected from the anvil by cutting the blue sutures.\nThe superior end of the conduit is opened along the staple line and the DST XL stapler (matching the diameter of the OrVil) introduced through the Alexis device. The stapler shaft is placed into the open end of the gastric conduit and the conduit pulled over it (‘sock over shoe’). The stapler spike is brought out through the greater curvature. The anvil is grasped with a Maryland grasper placed through a superior 5mm port and the two components of the stapler are mated and the stapler tightened and fired. The knob of the stapler is rotated two turns counter-clockwise until a click is felt, at which time the anvil will flip. The stapler is withdrawn and the donuts examined and sent for pathologic exam.\nThe anastomosis is completed by firing a Echelon Medium-Thick (Gold) linear) across the conduit cephalad to the anastomosis. The excess conduit is sent for pathologic exam as ‘additional gastric margin.’\nNG Tube A Covidien Salem Sump 18Fr nasogastric tube is passed by the anesthetist. A laparoscopic BK ultrasound is used to monitor the passage of the NG tube through the esophagus and into the gastric conduit. The NG tube is passed to the level that all for dots are outside the nose, with the 4th dot at the nares. The NG tube is secured with an AMT bridle.\nChest Tube A 28Fr Blake chest tube is placed through the anterior/inferior 12mm port and is positioned into the posterior mediastinum. JP2 is placed near the gastric conduit. The right lung is re-inflated.\nClosure The stapler access port incision is closed with 0 Vicryl to approximate the serratus muscle. The incisions are closed with 4-0 Monocryl followed by Dermabond.",
