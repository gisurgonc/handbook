# Rectal Ca Surgery

## Trans-abdominal Rectal Surgery

Trans-abdominal procedures include

- Low anterior resection: Removal of the rectum with an anastomosis between colon and distal rectum
- Hartmann resection: Removal of the rectum with end colostomy. The rectal stump is stapled. The anal sphincters are left in situ
- Abdominoperineal resection: Removal of rectum and anus from both an abdominal and perineal approach. The anal sphincters are removed. 

## Total Mesorectal Excision

Importance of total mesorectal excision was championed by Bill Heald [@heald1479] who emphasized sharp dissection of the mesorecum outside of the visceral fascial envelope. In addition he advocated dissection of the totality of the mesorectum distal to the tumor to avoid leaving behind nodes within the mesorectum distal to the tumor[@quirke996] [@nagtegaal303] [@paty365].
