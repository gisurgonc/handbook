# Postop Care after Esophagectomy {#mie_postop}

## Beta blockade and anti-hypertensives

Atrial fibrillation occurs in the postoperative period in 20% of patients. For this reason, beta blockers are used to atrial fibrillation prevention. In the ICU, metoprolol is administered intravenously and is subsequently changed to enteral administration. Because metoprolol also lowers blood pressure, patients on home anti-hypertensives frequently have them held during their hospital stay (and after discharge). At the first postoperative visit, patients who were not treated with beta blockade preoperatively are generally switched from metoprolol back to their home anti-hypertensives.

## Weaning Tube Feeds in Diabetics

As outpatients begin eating more orally, their tube feeds are reduced.

Weaning from 5 cans to 4 cans: Easiest method is to maintain the same schedule (16 hours) and reduce insulin dosage by 20%. For instance, the above patient who is on 5 cans at 75mL/hour x 16 hours is receiving 16N + 8R at start of tube feeds and 6 hours later. This patient could be weaned by reducing rate form 75mL/hour x 16 hours to 60mL/hour x 16 hours and reducing insulin to 12N + 6R at the start of tube feeds AND another dose of 12N + 6R after 6 hours.

Weaning from 4 cans to 3 cans: One option is to decrease the duration of tube feeds from 16 hours to 12 hours, while maintaining rate of 60mL/hour. In this case, the insulin dosage could be kept the same at the start of tube feeds, BUT the dose 6 hours after the start of tube feeds could be omitted.

Once patients are on 3 cans per night, further weaning can be accomplished by skipping tube feeds (and insulin) every other night in a “tube feed holiday”. This allows an evening of interrupted sleep and can tend to increase the appetite the morning after tube feeds are held.
